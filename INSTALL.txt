Thank you for installing SublimePrint! Here are some quick notes to get you
started. Please see https://github.com/svenax/SublimePrint for the full
documentation.

First make sure you have enscript installed. For most Linux distros and for
OS X before 10.8 this is done by default. There are builds for Windows too,
but I'm not sure how well those work.

The plugin provides three different print commands:
1. Print Entire File. Only works for saved files.
2. Print Selection. Works correctly with multiple selections.
3. Print Clipboard.

All configuration is done using Json settings files, accessible from
Preferences > Package Settings > SublimePrint. The first time you use
one of the print commands, a list of your installed printers is created
in the User settings file, together with information on what printer to
use. Initially that is your default printer, but you can change that if
you want.

If you have any comments or ideas, don't hesitate to contact me at
sven@axelsson.name. Happy printing!
